# DisplayCAL (a.k.a DispCalGUI) Python 3 update project

This is a project intended to (attempt to) modernize the DisplayCAL code for use with Python 3.
It was started as it appears that the DisplayCAL author is not interested in or motivated to do so
(Python 3 support has been a known issue with DisplayCAL for more than two years now).

Let tme do some progress report, as of today, the UI is working, though with some awkward things like copy/pasting the
required ``lang``, ``resources``, ``xrc``, ``ti1``, ``resources``, ``theme`` etc. folders which normally should have
been done by the ``setup.py``, these should be fairly easy to fix.

I have not tested doing a proper profiling yet!

Have fun!
