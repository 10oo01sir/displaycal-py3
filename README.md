# DisplayCAL (a.k.a DispCalGUI) Python 3 update project

This is a project intended to (attempt to) modernize the DisplayCAL code for use with Python 3.
It was started as it appears that the DisplayCAL author is not interested in or motivated to do so
(Python 3 support has been a known issue with DisplayCAL for more than two years now).
